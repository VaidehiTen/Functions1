        "   - FUNCTION : A function is a block of code to carry out a specific task, will contain its own scope and is called by name. All functions may contain zero(no) arguments or more than one arguments. On exit, a function can or can not return one or more values.\n",
        "   -Classes are not required to define a function.\n",
        "   -Functions are independent of objects as they are not defined within a class.\n",
        "   -Functions can be invoked just by calling their names.\n",
        "   -Functions perform their operation on the data that the user passes as arguments or parameters.\n",
        "   -These are independent entities of a Python code\n",
        "   -‘Self’ parameter is not required in the case of functions. Functions may have zero or many arguments.\n",

        "\n",
        "    print(result)  \n",
        "   - METHOD : A method in Python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes. Methods in Python are very similar to functions except for two major differences. (I)The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called.\n",
        "   -Methods are always defined within a class.\n",
        "   -Methods are linked to the objects of the class in which they are defined.\n",
        "   -A method cannot be invoked by calling its name alone. The class to which it belongs should be invoked.\n",

        "   - In Python, the terms “argument” and “parameter” are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.\n",
        "   - ARGUMENTS(Actual Values) : Arguments are the actual values that are passed to a function when it is called. In other words, they are the values that are used to replace the placeholders (parameters) in the function definition.\n",
        "   In Python, arguments are passed within the parentheses of a function call.\n",

        "\n",
        "   - PARAMETERS (PlaceHolder Values) :\n",
        "   Parameters are the input variables that are defined when defining a function. They serve as placeholders for the actual values that will be passed to the function when it is called.\n",

        "    - In Python, functions are fundamental building blocks that allow you to encapsulate code for reuse and clarity.\n",
        "    - Defining Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "      (i) Standard Function (Named Function) :\n",
        "      The most common way to define a function is using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example : def greet(name):\n",
        "\n",
        "      print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "      (ii) Anonymous Function (Lambda Function) :\n",
        "      Lambda functions are small, unnamed functions defined using the lambda keyword. They are typically used for short, simple operations.\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Example : square = lambda x: x * x\n",
        "      \n",
        "      print(square(5))  # Output: 25\n",
        "\n",
        "      (iii) Recursive Function :\n",
        "      A recursive function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This approach is useful for tasks like calculating factorials or traversing hierarchical structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example : def factorial(n):\n",
        "\n",
        "     if n == 1:\n",

        "\n",
        "      (iv) Higher-Order Function :\n",
        "      Higher-order functions take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This is common in functional programming paradigms.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example : def apply_function(f, x):\n",
        "\n",
        "     return f(x)\n",
        "\n",
        "     result = apply_function(lambda x: x + 2, 5)\n",

        "    - Calling Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "      (i) Direct Function Call :\n",
        "      Call the function by its name followed by parentheses containing any required arguments.\n",

        "\n",
        "      (ii) Using Default Parameters :\n",
        "      Functions can have default values for parameters, allowing you to call them without providing all arguments.\n",
        "      \n",
        "      Example : def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
        "\n",
        "      print(f\"{message}, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "      greet(\"Bob\")  # Output: Hello, Bob!\n",
        "    \n",
        "      greet(\"Charlie\", \"Hi\")  # Output: Hi, Charlie!\n",
        "\n",
        "      (iii) Using Variable-Length Arguments :\n",
        "      You can define functions that accept a variable number of positional (*args) or keyword arguments (**kwargs).\n",
        "      Eaxmple :\n",
        "      (iv) Using Partial Functions :\n",
        "      The functools.partial function allows you to fix a certain number of arguments of a function and generate a new function.\n",
        "\n",
        "      (v) Using eval() :\n",
        "      The eval() function parses the expression passed to it and executes a valid Python expression within the program. This can be used to call functions dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "   - The return statement is a crucial part of Python functions, as it allows you to send data back from the function to the caller. When a function encounters a return statement, it immediately exits the function and returns the specified value(s) to the caller.\n",
        "   - The Purpose of the Return Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "     The primary purpose of the return statement is to allow functions to produce output that can be used by the caller. This output can be a single value, multiple values, or even a complex data structure like a list or a dictionary. The returned value(s) can then be stored in a variable, used in further calculations, or passed to another function.\n",
        "   - Example :\n",
        "\n",
        "     def square(number):\n",
        "\n",
        "     return number ** 2\n",
        "\n",
        "     result = square(5)\n",
        "     \n",
        "     print(result)      \n",
        "     #### Output: 25  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "   - An iterator : is an object representing a stream of data; it returns one element at a time from the iterable. Iterators are used to traverse through all the elements of an iterable.\n",

        "   - A generator is a function that produces a sequence of values lazily, one at a time, rather than storing all values in memory at once. It allows for efficient iteration over large datasets or infinite sequences without loading the entire dataset into memory.\n",
        "   - Benefits of Using Generators:\n",
        "\n",
        "     >Memory Efficiency: Generators produce items one at a time and only when needed, reducing memory usage compared to storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "     >State Preservation: Generators maintain their state between iterations, allowing for complex iteration patterns.\n",
        "   - To define a generator, use the 'def' keyword as you would for a regular function, but include one or more 'yield' statements to produce values.\n",

        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "   - Using generators in Python offers several advantages over regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets or streams of data.\n",
        "    >Memory Efficiency :\n",
        "     Generators produce items one at a time and only when needed, which is known as \"lazy evaluation.\" This approach significantly reduces memory usage compared to regular functions that generate and store entire sequences in memory. For instance, a generator expression uses only a fraction of the memory compared to a list comprehension.\n",
        "\n",
        "    >State Preservation :\n",
        "     Generators maintain their internal state between iterations. After yielding a value, the generator function pauses its execution and retains its local variables. On the next call, it resumes from where it left off. Regular functions, however, do not preserve state between calls.\n",
